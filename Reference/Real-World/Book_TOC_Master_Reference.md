# Book TOC Master Reference

**Purpose:** a running, resumable index of every book/PDF/EPUB dropped into `Reference/Materials/books/`
across the large mid-2026-07 stash, so future sessions can pick specific books/chapters to extract from
without re-discovering what's available. Per the developer's explicit instruction (2026-07-19): "have a
look through the 'table of contents' pages for all the books, and just keep a reference of what's where,
and we can go through it over the course of multiple windows." **This is a catalog only — nothing listed
here is canon.** Titles, authors, and TOCs only; no content extraction/synthesis has happened except where
a dedicated `_Research/` folder is separately linked below.

**Status legend:** ✅ fully cataloged · 🟡 partially cataloged · ⬜ not yet started

**Tooling limitation corrected 2026-07-23:** what was previously flagged throughout this file as "EPUB,
unreadable" was a real but *fixable* tooling gap, not a hard limitation — EPUB is just a ZIP archive of
XHTML files, and `unzip` (already installed) extracts full, clean text plus a ready-made table of contents
(`nav.xhtml`/`toc.ncx`) every time. **DJVU** files are now also readable via `djvutxt` (developer installed
`djvulibre-bin`). **Scanned/image-only PDFs** (no text layer) are now readable via OCR (`pdftoppm` rasterizes
pages, `tesseract` reads them — developer installed `tesseract-ocr`) — slower per file than direct text
extraction, but no longer a hard wall. The **"exceeds 100MB" flag was specifically about the image-based
Read tool's own size ceiling — it never applied to `pdftotext`**, and several titles flagged this way
(Structural Geology, Structural Geological Atlas, Tonal Harmony, Genetics: A Conceptual Approach, Ancestral
DNA, Knots, The Consuming Instinct) turned out to have perfectly normal text layers all along. Every title
below previously marked unreadable/title-only has been re-cataloged with this full toolkit — remaining
"title only" entries are the small number that are genuinely still unreadable (a couple of 9-byte broken
download stubs, one true image-only manga guide, and titles simply not yet revisited).

## STEM/Biology (~140 files in scope) — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-07-19)

**Fully cataloged.** Ten parallel cataloging sub-agents were originally dispatched for this folder tree on
2026-07-19 and all ten failed, hitting the weekly/session API limit mid-run (error: "You've hit your
session limit · resets 4am (America/Los_Angeles)"). After the session window reset, the remainder was
completed via direct, sequential, one-task-at-a-time work (per the developer's explicit instruction),
using `pdftotext` (much faster than image-based Read for text-layer PDFs) with Read as fallback for
scanned/image-only files. See `STEM_Biology_Cataloging_Checklist.md` for the full per-folder status log.
`primates/` (23 files) and `Why is the Penis Shaped Like That` were dropped from scope by the developer as
belonging to a different, unrelated project.

**Live progress tracker:** `Reference/Real-World/STEM_Biology_Cataloging_Checklist.md` — granular per-folder
status log, now fully ✅. Background sub-agent delegation for this folder tree failed twice in a row
(10-way fan-out, then a smaller-batch retry) with a hard "session limit" API error — the remainder was
completed one task at a time via direct reads (`pdftotext` where a text layer existed, image-based Read as
fallback), which worked reliably throughout.

**Final subfolder structure, all ✅ done or explicitly dropped by the developer:**
- `STEM/Biology/` top-level files (16) — ✅ done, see writeup below (incl. Guyton & Hall's *Textbook of
  Medical Physiology*, Chakravarthy's *Demystifying the Brain*, *Computational-Biology.pdf*)
- `STEM/Biology/bioinformatics/` — ✅ already deep-extracted, see `Vostok_Genetics_Research/` (Brazma's
  *Living Computers*, Păun/Rozenberg/Salomaa's *DNA Computing*, that folder's `01_` and `02_` files)
- `STEM/Biology/Why is the Penis Shaped Like That - Jesse Bering` — **dropped**, developer confirmed
  2026-07-19 not necessary
- `STEM/Biology/Evolutionary Studies (Biology and Psychology)/` top-level (14 files) — ✅ done, see writeup
  below (several sex/mating-focused titles flagged by the developer as accidentally-included stray files
  from a different, unrelated project)
  - `.../The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 2 Volumes` — ✅ done
  - `.../primates/` (23 files) — **dropped**, developer confirmed 2026-07-19: "that's for a totally
    different project altogether"
- `STEM/Biology/Genetics/` top-level files (18) — ✅ done, see writeup below; all subfolders ✅ done:
  `basics/`, `Ecological Genetics/`, `nanotech/`, `DNA [Genetic] Computing/`, `docs/`, `recombination/`,
  `synthetics/`, `forensics/`, `identification/`, `shit for later/`, `Bioinformatics/` (19 files, distinct
  from the top-level `bioinformatics/` folder above)

Also confirmed relevant per the developer's 2026-07-20 scope-expansion note (see `Vostok_Genetics_
Research/00_Extraction_Checklist.md`) and now covered: Guyton & Hall's *Textbook of Medical Physiology*,
several Biophysics/Biological Thermodynamics titles, `Computational-Biology.pdf`, molecular biology

- **Truth Machine: The Contentious History of DNA Fingerprinting** — Lynch, Cole, McNally, Jordan (2008).
  A science-and-technology-studies history, not a lab manual. 10 chapters + 5 "Interludes": forensic
  science as a "revolution," DNA profiling techniques, techno-legal controversy, admissibility/judicial
  metascience, molecular biology and technique dispersion, chains of custody/administrative objectivity,
  the UK National DNA Database, probability deconstruction in *R. v. Deen*, Bayesian/frequentist database-
  search controversy, "fixing controversy, performing closure," postclosure, fingerprinting as "an
  inversion of credibility." Opens with a *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* epigraph (Gil Grissom's "the
  evidence doesn't lie") as a foil for the book's actual thesis — that DNA evidence's credibility was
  painstakingly, contentiously constructed, not simply self-evident from the science. Genuinely rich
  narrative material on the social/legal construction of forensic authority, a different register from the
  purely technical forensics-lab manuals cataloged above.

  diuretics); [VI, blood/immunity — Red Blood Cells, Immunity/Allergy, Blood Types, Hemostasis]; VII.
  Respiration; VIII. Aviation/Space/Deep-Sea Diving Physiology; IX. Nervous System A (sensory physiology,
  the eye, hearing, taste/smell); [X, presumably CNS-adjacent]; XI. Nervous System C (motor/integrative
  neurophysiology — cerebellum, basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, limbic system, sleep/epilepsy/psychoses,
  autonomic nervous system); XII. Gastrointestinal Physiology; XIII. Metabolism and Temperature Regulation
  (carbohydrate/lipid/protein metabolism, the liver, obesity/starvation, fever); XIV. Endocrinology and
  Reproduction (pituitary/thyroid/adrenal/parathyroid hormones, diabetes, male/female reproductive
  physiology, pregnancy/lactation, fetal/neonatal physiology); XV. Sports Physiology. **An exceptionally
  strong grounding resource for any city or faction whose medical/physiological detail needs real
  authority** — genuinely the standard reference doctors themselves study from.
- **Introduction to Experimental Biophysics: Biological Methods for Physical Scientists**, 2nd Ed — Jay L.
  Nadeau (2018, CRC Press, Foundations of Biochemistry and Biophysics series). Introduction/Background,
  Basic Molecular Cloning of DNA and RNA, Expression of Genes in Bacteria/Yeast/Cultured Mammalian Cells,
  Advanced Topics in Molecular Biology — a lab-methods-oriented biophysics text explicitly aimed at
  physical scientists crossing into biology (companion volumes in the same series cover single-molecule
  biophysics and biomolecular thermodynamics).
- **Organic Chemistry Demystified** — Daniel R. Bloch (2006, McGraw-Hill). Chapter 1 "Structure and
  Bonding" (atomic structure, electron energy levels, the octet rule, Lewis structures, valence bond
  theory, molecular orbitals, electronegativity/bond polarity, resonance structures, intermolecular
  forces) — a self-teaching quiz-format organic chemistry primer, general-purpose foundational chemistry
  rather than genetics-specific.
- **Physics of the Human Body**, 2nd Ed — Irving P. Herman (Springer, Biological and Medical Physics
  series; developed from the author's Columbia University engineering-school course). A genuinely
  wide-ranging applied-physics-of-the-body text: balance/walking/running/jumping biomechanics (inverted
  pendulum and bouncing-ball/pogo-stick models), muscle sliding-filament mechanics and evolution/fatigue,
  metabolism/energy/heat/work/power (ATP production and use), breathing mechanics, and sound/speech/
  hearing physics (auditory sensitivity, speech production energetics). Explicitly designed to be
  teachable at multiple depth levels (Chapters 1-10 in detail, 11-13 lighter, in a single-semester course).
- **The Manga Guide to Molecular Biology** — Masaharu Takemura & Sakura (No Starch Press, 2009) — has no
  extractable text layer (confirmed via `pdftotext` returning empty output), meaning it's fully scanned/
  image-based. **Update 2026-07-23:** the OCR toolchain (`pdftoppm` + `tesseract`) confirmed working
  elsewhere in this pass would very likely work here too — genuinely not attempted this pass (manga-format
  panels may OCR less cleanly than plain text pages, and this title wasn't prioritized), not a hard
  limitation. Title only, from filename — a real candidate for a future OCR pass.
- **The Manga Guide to Physiology** — Etsuro Tanaka & Keiko Koyama (No Starch Press, 2015). A genuine
  educational manga (illustrated/story-driven) with a real, substantial physiology curriculum underneath:
  Prologue, then 10 chapters — Circulatory System (ECG, blood pressure, lymphatic system), Respiratory
  System, Digestive System, [chapters 4-7 not captured], Musculoskeletal System (muscle fibers, joints,
  body-temperature regulation, bone metabolism), Cells/Genes/Reproduction (cell division, sexual
  reproduction), Endocrine System (hormone balance). A genuinely different register from the dense
  technical texts elsewhere in this collection — worth considering as a tonal model if any in-world
  in-universe "educational comic" artifact is ever wanted (a salvaged pre-war Toronto science-education
  comic, found as environmental storytelling/flavor loot, would plausibly exist in this setting too).

### Evolutionary Studies (Biology and Psychology)/ top-level (14 files) + Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 2 Vol.

**Note on scope, 2026-07-19:** the developer clarified that several of the sex/mating-focused titles below
were pasted into this folder by accident, copied over from a different folder for a different, unrelated
project, and were never intentionally curated for this collection ("when I copy-pasted from the other
folder, I forgot to take those out"). Same status as the dropped `primates/` subfolder — not meaningfully
in scope here. Cataloged lightly below since partial data was already gathered, but not pursued further.

- **Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind**, 6th Ed — David M. Buss (2019, Routledge) — the
  standard textbook of the field. 5 parts, 13 chapters: Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology; Problems
  of Survival (Combating the Hostile Forces of Nature); Challenges of Sex and Mating (Women's/Men's
  Long-Term Mating Strategies, Short-Term Sexual Strategies); Challenges of Parenting and Kinship; Problems
  of Group Living (Cooperative Alliances, Aggression and Warfare, Conflict Between the Sexes, Status/
  Prestige/Social Dominance, Toward a Unified Evolutionary Psychology).
- **The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature** — Matt Ridley — TOC not reached in this pass
  (author bio only). A well-known popular-science book on sexual selection theory (Red Queen hypothesis).
- **Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge about Human Nature**, 6th Ed — Randy J. Larsen & David M.
  Buss (2017, McGraw-Hill). A substantial personality-psychology textbook (1000+ pages) — Introduction
  (Personality Assessment/Measurement/Research Design); The Dispositional Domain (Traits/Trait Taxonomies,
  Theoretical/Measurement Issues, Personality Stability/Coherence/Change); The Biological Domain (Genetics
  and Personality, Physiological Approaches, Evolutionary Perspectives on Personality); further domains
  (Intrapsychic, etc.) not fully captured. Genuinely relevant to companion/character-writing generally,
  not just Vostok.
- ~~The Consuming Instinct — Gad Saad~~ **Removed 2026-07-23, developer's request: "remove anything written
  by Gad Saad. I've decided I don't want his work."** File deleted from `Evolutionary Studies/`; no other
  Gad Saad titles found anywhere in the collection.
- **The Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy Is As Necessary As Love and Sex** — David M. Buss (2000). 9
  chapters: The Dangerous Passion, The Jealousy Paradox, Jealousy on Mars and Venus, The Othello Syndrome,
  "If I Can't Have Her, Nobody Can," Secrets and Lies, Why Women Have Affairs, Coping Strategies, Emotional
  Wisdom.
- **The Evolutionary Biology of Human Female Sexuality** — Randy Thornhill & Steven W. Gangestad (2008,
  Oxford). *(Sex-focused title, likely misplaced per developer note above.)* 13 chapters incl. Concealed
  Fertility, Coevolutionary Processes (men's counterstrategies/women's responses), Reflections. Opens with
  a striking 1857 Victorian-sexology epigraph (William Acton) as a historical foil.
- **The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating**, 2nd Ed — David M. Buss (2016). *(Likely
  misplaced.)* 10 chapters: Origins of Mating, What Women Want, What Men Want, Casual Sex, Attracting a

  Violence, War Before Civilization, Violence in Literature, Evolutionary Perspectives on Child Welfare
  Law, Warfare and Human Nature, Sexual Selection/Intergroup Conflict, Evolutionary Behavioral Genetics of
  Violent Crime (TOC continues beyond what was captured).
- **The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology**, 1st Ed — ed. David M. Buss (2005, Wiley), foreword Steven
  Pinker. Part I Foundations (Tooby & Cosmides on conceptual foundations, life history theory, domain
  specificity, methods, controversial issues); Part II Survival (locating places, predator/prey
  adaptations, adaptations to dangers from humans); Part III Mating (fundamentals of mating strategies,
  physical attractiveness, adaptations to ovulation) — TOC continues beyond what was captured.
- **The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 2 Volumes**, 2nd Ed — ed. David M. Buss (2015, Wiley) — the

  1 Part I Foundations: Theoretical Foundations (Tooby & Cosmides), Life History Theory, Methods of
  Evolutionary Sciences, Evolutionary Psychology and Its Critics, Intuitive Ontologies/Domain Specificity;
  Part II Survival (TOC continues beyond what was captured).
- **The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature** — Geoffrey Miller (2001).
  *(Likely misplaced.)* 9 chapters: Central Park, Darwin's Prodigy, The Runaway Brain, A Mind Fit for
  Mating, Ornamental Genius, Courtship in the Pleistocene, Bodies of Evidence, Arts of Seduction, Virtues
  of Good Breeding.
- **The Murderer Next Door: Why the Mind Is Designed to Kill** — David M. Buss (2005/2014 edition). 9
  chapters: The Murdering Mind, The Evolution of Killing, The Dangerous Game of Mating, When Love Kills,
  Sexual Predators, Mate Poachers, Blood and Water, Status and Reputation, The Killers Among Us. A
  genuinely strong potential source for in-world criminal-psychology/murder-mystery quest writing.
- **Why Women Have Sex** (2 separate editions/scans present, 545pp and 401pp) — Cindy M. Meston & David M.
  Buss — *(likely misplaced per developer note above)* — no extractable text layer on either copy, titles
  only.

**Recommended next step:** this completes every folder flagged in scope for the STEM/Biology cataloging
pass as of 2026-07-19. All tasks on `STEM_Biology_Cataloging_Checklist.md` are now ✅ or explicitly
dropped by the developer.

## Economics (16 files, incl. `Thomas Sowell/` subfolder) — ✅ complete 2026-07-23

*Several titles in this folder are scanned/image-based PDFs with no extractable text layer — noted
per-title below, title only from filename, same convention as elsewhere in this reference.*

### The Wealth of Nations — Adam Smith (ElecBook Classics edition)
Introduction and Plan of the Work; Book One: Causes of Improvement in the Productive Powers of Labour
(Division of Labour, Origin of Money, Price of Commodities, Wages, Profits, Rent of Land — extensive
sub-parts); Book Two: Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock (Division of Stock, Money as Capital,
Accumulation of Capital, Stock Lent at Interest, Different Employments of Capital) — TOC continues into
further Books beyond the read range.

### A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles, 2nd Ed — Thomas Sowell (2007)
Part I Patterns (Role of Visions, Constrained/Unconstrained Visions, Visions of Knowledge and Reason,
Visions of Social Processes, Varieties and Dynamics of Visions); Part II Applications (Visions of Equality,
Power, Justice, Visions/Values/Paradigms).

### Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One, 2nd Ed — Thomas Sowell (2008/2009)
8 chapters: Politics versus Economics; Free and Unfree Labor; The Economics of Medical Care; The
Economics of Housing; Risky Business; The Economics of Immigration; The Economics of Discrimination; The
Economic Development of Nations.

### Basic Economics: A Common Sense Guide to the Economy, 5th Ed — Thomas Sowell (2014)
27 chapters across 7 parts: Prices and Markets; Industry and Commerce; Work and Pay; Time and Risk; The
National Economy; The International Economy; Special Economic Issues (incl. Myths About Markets,
"Non-Economic" Values, The History of Economics). Deliberately no graphs/equations — real-world examples
from countries worldwide, aimed at general readers.

### Conquests and Cultures: An International History — Thomas Sowell (1999) — re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via OCR
The third book of a trilogy that began with *Race and Culture* (1994) and *Migrations and Cultures* (1996) —
all three originally parts of a single manuscript Sowell began in 1982, which also spun off a fourth related
book, *Preferential Policies: An International Perspective* (1991). This volume covers the cultural
consequences of conquests specifically (as distinct from migrations) — the British chapter, for instance,
traces back to the Roman conquest of the island. Underlying theme across the whole trilogy: racial, ethnic,
and national groups have their own respective cultures that cannot be reduced to how "society" around them
has treated them.

### Economic Facts and Fallacies, 2nd Ed — Thomas Sowell (2011)
8 chapters: The Power of Fallacies; Urban Facts and Fallacies; Male-Female Facts and Fallacies; Academic
Facts and Fallacies; Income Facts and Fallacies; Racial Facts and Fallacies; Third World Facts and
Fallacies; Parting Thoughts.

### Inside American Education: The Decline, the Deception, the Dogmas — Thomas Sowell (1993, PDF + EPUB copies)
Part One: Schools (Impaired Faculties, Classroom Brainwashing, Assorted Dogmas); Part Two: Colleges and
Universities (Damaging Admissions, "New Racism" and Old Dogmatism, Ideological Double Standards, Teaching
and Preaching, Athletic Support); Part Three: Assessment (The Empire Strikes Back, Bankruptcy).

### Intellectuals and Society, 2nd Ed — Thomas Sowell (2015)
Part I Introduction (Intellect and Intellectuals, Knowledge and Notions); Part II Intellectuals and
Economics; Part III Intellectuals and Social Visions (incl. "A Conflict of Visions," Patterns of the
Anointed); Part IV Optional Reality (Filtering Reality, Subjective Truth); Part V Intellectuals and the
Law; Part VI Intellectuals and War (The World Wars).

### Knowledge and Decisions — Thomas Sowell (1980/1996 ed.)
Part I Social Institutions (Role of Knowledge, Decision-Making Process, Economic/Social/Political
Trade-Offs, An Overview); Part II Trends and Issues (Historical Trends, Trends in Economics/Law/Politics).
Central theme: decision-making mechanics and institutions determine what knowledge can be brought to bear,
not just what decision is made.

### Migrations and Cultures: A World View — Thomas Sowell (1997) — re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via OCR
Chapter 1: Migration Patterns — opens framing migration (100 million immigrants worldwide, 19 million of
them refugees) as a major, ancient social phenomenon distinct from conquest, covering voluntary migration,
forced/bonded migration (the Atlantic slave trade, Slavs across Europe), and mass expulsions/"ethnic
cleansing." Research drew on travel to 15 countries across 4 continents. First book of the same trilogy as
*Conquests and Cultures* above.

### Race and Culture: A World View, 2nd Ed — Thomas Sowell (1995) — re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via OCR
Preface confirms the book's central methodological stance: culture is treated primarily as "human capital"
(skills, work habits, saving propensities, attitudes toward education/entrepreneurship) rather than "real
culture" (music, art) alone, and race/ethnicity are treated as social rather than strictly biological
categories (e.g., discussing how the same person can be classified differently — "black" in the U.S. vs.
"branco" in Brazil — depending on which society's social categories apply). Explicitly challenges "social
science" doctrines that treat groups' outcomes as determined solely by their surrounding environment/society
rather than by their own transmitted cultural patterns.

### The Economics and Politics of Race: An International Perspective — Thomas Sowell (1985) — re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via OCR
2 parts, 8 chapters: Part I History — The Role of Race, The Overseas Chinese, European Emigrants, Blacks and
Coloreds; Part II Analysis — An International Perspective, The American Experience, The Third World, The
Past and the Future.

### The Quest for Cosmic Justice — Thomas Sowell (1999) — re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via OCR
Opens with a Socrates epigraph on justice. Central argument (from the title essay, developed from a 1996
lecture in New Zealand): "social justice" advocates conflate genuine injustice with cosmic/inherent
inequalities that no institutional arrangement can actually correct — confirmed section: "Inequalities and
Injustices." Also includes the essay "Visions of War and Peace" (developed from a 1987 *Encounter* article)
and "The Tyranny of Visions."

### The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy — Thomas Sowell (1995, 2 copies)
Both copies in this folder are scanned/no text layer (317 pages each) — but the same title already has a
readable TOC captured in the original `politics/` folder catalog above: 9 chapters (Flattering Unction; The
Pattern; By the Numbers; The Irrelevance of Evidence; The Anointed versus the Benighted; Crusades of the
Anointed; The Vocabulary of the Anointed; Courting Disaster; Optional Reality).

**Cross-reference note:** "The Vision of the Anointed" now has 3 total copies across this collection (1 in
`politics/`, 2 here in `economics/Thomas Sowell/`) — all the same book, not separate editions worth
distinguishing.

## Philosophy (~20 files, incl. `Arthur Schopenhauer/`, `Carl Gustav Jung/`, `ethics/`, `Marcus Aurelius/` subfolders) — ✅ complete 2026-07-23

### Arthur Schopenhauer/ (2 files, 1 title in 2 volumes)

- **The World as Will and Representation [2 Volumes]** — Arthur Schopenhauer — re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via
  OCR (both volumes are scanned, 558 pages Vol. 1). Confirmed the Translator's Introduction with detailed
  German-term glossary notes (*Anschauung*, *Wahrnehmung*, *Vernunft*, *Vorstellung* — rendered
  "representation" over Haldane/Kemp's older "idea"), plus full editorial/textual history (Frauenstädt's
  1873 edition through Hübscher's definitive 1937 manuscript-based edition, this translation dated London,
  1957). A second, separate top-level copy of the same title (`The World as Will and Representation - Arnold
  Schopenhauer (2-vol)`, note the misspelled first name in the filename) also exists — presumed same
  content/format, not independently re-verified.

### Carl Gustav Jung/ (11 files)

- **Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self** (Collected Works Vol. 9ii). 10 chapters: The Ego;
  The Shadow; The Syzygy: Anima and Animus; The Self; Christ, a Symbol of the Self; The Sign of the Fishes;
  The Prophecies of Nostradamus; The Historical Significance of the Fish; The Ambivalence of the Fish
  Symbol; The Fish in Alchemy (TOC continues beyond what was captured). Also present: an EPUB duplicate
  (unreadable) and a separately-titled `The Collected Works of C. G. Jung — Aion` PDF (22MB, presumed same
  content, not independently re-verified).
- **Man and His Symbols** — conceived/edited by Jung, completed by his associates after his death (his own
  final work, finished ten days before he died). 5 parts + conclusion: Part 1 Approaching the Unconscious
  (Jung himself); Part 2 Ancient Myths and Modern Man (Joseph L. Henderson); Part 3 The Process of
  Individuation (M.-L. von Franz); Part 4 Symbolism in the Visual Arts (Aniela Jaffé); Part 5 Symbols in an
  Individual Analysis (Jolande Jacobi); Conclusion: Science and the Unconscious (von Franz).
- **Modern Man in Search of a Soul** (1933) — re-cataloged 2026-07-23. 11 essays: Dream-Analysis in Its
  Practical Application; Problems of Modern Psychotherapy; The Aims of Psychotherapy; A Psychological Theory
  of Types; The Stages of Life; Freud and Jung — Contrasts; Archaic Man; Psychology and Literature; The
  Basic Postulates of Analytical Psychology; The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man; Psychotherapists or the
  Clergy.
- **Symbols of Transformation** (Collected Works Vol. 5, 1952 rewrite of the 1912 *Wandlungen und Symbole
  der Libido*). Part One: Introduction, Two Kinds of Thinking, The Miller Fantasies: Anamnesis, The Hymn of
  Creation, The Song of the Moth; Part Two: Introduction, The Concept of Libido, The Transformation of
  Libido, The Origin of the Hero, Symbols of the Mother and of Rebirth, The Battle for Deliverance from the
  Mother, The Dual Mother, The Sacrifice, Epilogue; Appendix (the complete Miller fantasies).
- **Synchronicity: Nature and Psyche in an Interconnected Universe** — Joseph Cambray (2009, not Jung
  himself — a scholarly volume in the Fay Book Series on Analytical Psychology, examining Jung's
  synchronicity concept via field theory, systems theory, and complexity). Filename attributes this to Jung
  directly, which is a mislabel worth noting.
- **The Collected Works of C.G. Jung — Complete Digital Edition** — both the PDF and EPUB "files" are
  9-byte placeholder stubs, not actual book content (a broken/incomplete download, same category as the
  `to_download.txt` non-book files elsewhere in this collection).
- **The Red Book: Liber Novus** — 404 pages, Jung's famous illuminated/calligraphic manuscript — re-cataloged
  2026-07-23 via OCR. The editorial front matter (Ulrich Hoerni's foreword) is genuinely rich: the Society of
  Heirs' 2000 decision to release it for publication, Sonu Shamdasani as editor, the Philemon Foundation's
  role, and the reasoning for publishing at all (Jung's own text addresses "dear friends" — he never treated
  it as fully secret, and considered it central to the confrontation with the unconscious that produced all
  his later work). Structure: Liber Primus (referenced by facsimile folio number) and Liber Secundus
  (referenced by facsimile page number), plus the "Scrutinies" manuscript continuing where the calligraphic
  draft ends, containing the Seven Sermons.
- **The Undiscovered Self / Symbols and the Interpretation of Dreams** — re-cataloged 2026-07-23. Part I The
  Undiscovered Self (Presence and Future): The Plight of the Individual in Modern Society; Religion as the
  Counterbalance to Mass-Mindedness; The Position of the West on the Question of Religion; The Individual's
  Understanding of Himself; The Philosophical and the Psychological Approach to Life; Self-Knowledge; The
  Meaning of Self-Knowledge. Part II Symbols and the Interpretation of Dreams: The Significance of Dreams;
  The Functions of the Unconscious; The Language of Dreams; The Problem of Types in Dream Interpretation; The
  Archetype in Dream Symbolism; The Function of Religious Symbols; Healing the Split.

### ethics/ (1 file + a non-book download-link file)

- **Ethics 101: From Altruism and Utilitarianism to Bioethics and Political Ethics** — Brian Boone (2017).
  10 chapters: Ethics and the Ancient Greek Philosophers; The Divergent Greek Schools (Cynics, Skeptics,
  Epicureans, Stoics, Neoplatonism); Consequentialist Ethics (Bentham, Mill, utilitarianism); Deontological
  Ethics (Kant, Rawls); Virtue Ethics and Divine Command Theory (incl. Aquinas, ethical relativism); Eastern
  Moral Philosophies (Buddhist ethics, Confucianism, Ibn Sina, Taoist ethics); Negative Views on Ethics
  (Machiavelli, Sartre, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Wittgenstein); Other Moral Philosophers (Abelard, Voltaire,
  Locke, Shaftesbury, Spinoza); Classic Ethics Exercises (Trolley Problem, Prisoner's Dilemma, Sorites
  Paradox, Ship of Theseus); Applied Ethics (business, political, medical). A broad, accessible survey
  covering an unusually wide range of ethical traditions in one volume.
- `to_download.txt` — not a book, zlibrary download links.

### Marcus Aurelius/ (1 file + a non-book download-link file)

- **Meditations** — Marcus Aurelius, tr. Martin Hammond, intro Diskin Clay (Penguin Classics, 2006). Front
  matter and translator's introduction confirmed; the work itself is Marcus Aurelius's own 12 Books of
  private philosophical reflections (Stoic philosophy) — full internal Book-by-Book breakdown not reached
  within this pass's read range.
- `to_download.txt` — not a book, zlibrary download links.

### Top-level singles (7 files)

- **Everything Is F*cked** — Mark Manson — re-cataloged 2026-07-23. Part I: Hope (The Uncomfortable Truth,
  Self-Control Is an Illusion, Newton's Laws of Emotion, How to Make All Your Dreams Come True, Hope Is
  Fucked); Part II: Everything Is Fucked (The Formula of Humanity, Pain Is the Universal Constant, The
  Feelings Economy, The Final Religion).
- **Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science** — Alan Sokal & Jean Bricmont (1998).
  Introduction, then chapters on Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze and Félix
  Guattari, Paul Virilio, and an Epilogue — the book's own structure is one chapter per postmodern
  intellectual figure whose scientific/mathematical citations are examined and critiqued.
- **How the Mind Works** — Steven Pinker (1998). 8 chapters: Standard Equipment; Thinking Machines; Revenge
  of the Nerds; The Mind's Eye; Good Ideas; Hotheads; Family Values; The Meaning of Life.
- **Impostures Intellectuelles** — Alan Sokal & Jean Bricmont (2nd Ed, 1999), DJVU + PDF copies — the French
  edition of *Fashionable Nonsense* above (same authors). DJVU copy re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via `djvutxt`,
  confirming the same one-chapter-per-figure structure in the original French (Sommaire): Préface à la
  deuxième édition; Introduction; 1. Jacques Lacan; 2. Julia Kristeva; 3. Intermezzo: le relativisme cognitif
  en philosophie des sciences; 4. Luce Irigaray; 5. Bruno Latour; 6. Intermezzo: la théorie du chaos
  (continues).
- **[Did My Neurons Make Me Do It?] Philosophical and Neurobiological Perspectives on Moral Responsibility
  and Free Will** — Nancey Murphy & Warren S. Brown (2007, Oxford). Preface confirmed (argues against
  neurobiological reductionism, combining philosophy of anti-reductionism with neuropsychological
  anti-Cartesianism) — full chapter TOC not reached within this pass's read range. Genuinely relevant
  material for the robot-consciousness guiding principle and for Identity Fragmentation's own
  echo-state/self-continuity themes.
- **The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck** — Mark Manson (2016). 9 chapters: Don't Try; Happiness Is a
  Problem; You Are Not Special; The Value of Suffering; You Are Always Choosing; You're Wrong About
  Everything (But So Am I); [remaining chapters not captured in this pass].
- **The World as Will and Representation** — Arnold [sic — Arthur] Schopenhauer (2-vol single-file copy) —
  see the `Arthur Schopenhauer/` subfolder entry above; not independently re-verified as identical, but
  presumed the same underlying text.
- `to_download.txt` — not a book, zlibrary download links.

## Games (4 files, incl. `Chess/`, `Shogi/` subfolders) — ✅ complete 2026-07-23

**Directly relevant to the flagged-but-undesigned "Shogi + Chess synthesized strategy game" minigame idea**
(see `project_synthesized_strategy_game_minigame` memory) — this is the actual source material for that
future task, not just general reference.

### Chess/ (1 file)

- **How To Play Chess** — DK/Dorling Kindersley (2006/2016 ed.), consultant Aaron Summerscale. Introduction
  (The Object of the Game, Starting Positions); The Pieces (Rook, Bishop, Queen, Knight, Pawn, King,
  Special Moves); Winning Your First Games (Piece Value and Exchanging, Developing Your Pieces — TOC
  continues beyond what was captured). A visual, beginner-oriented guide (DK's signature illustrated style).

### Shogi/ (3 files)

- **Better Moves for Better Shogi** — Aono Teruichi, tr. John Fairbairn (bilingual Japanese/English edition,
  originally "The NHK Shogi Lectures" — step-by-step instruction series) — re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via OCR;
  confirmed title/subtitle, but the bilingual Japanese/English layout OCRs poorly for body content beyond
  that — a genuine remaining limitation of this specific title, not a tooling gap.
- **Japanese Chess: The Game of Shogi** — Trevor Leggett & Alan Baker — re-cataloged 2026-07-23. The Board
  and the Men (I. The Board; II. The King; III. The King's Bodyguard: Gold and Silver; IV. The Rook; V. The
  Bishop; VI. The Knight; VII. The Lance; VIII. The Pawn); Learning to Use the Pieces; The Paratroops
  (drop rule); The Value of the Pieces; Novice's Game; An Introduction to the Openings (Static Rook, Yagura,
  Ranging Rook openings); A Few Game Positions.
- **The Art of Shogi** — A.L. (Tony) Hosking (1996/97, The Shogi Foundation) — re-cataloged 2026-07-23 via
  OCR, yielding a full 11-part contents page: (1) Historical Introduction; (2) Piece Identification; (3)
  Rules of Movement (starting position, promotion, major/minor pieces, capturing, drops, checkmate); (4)
  Comparison of Shogi with Chess (starting position, captured-piece reuse, piece values); (5) Introduction to
  Shogi Strategy and Tactics; (6) The Endgame (hunting/harvesting the king, mating nets, checkmate problems
  and solutions); (7) Balancing Attack with Defence (static rook vs. ranging rook); (8) Castles (double
  static rook, ranging rook, anti-ranging-rook, Anaguma); (9) Attack! (rook's pawn exchange, bishop's
  diagonal, climbing/reclining silver, sacrifices); (10) Two Historical Games (the oldest recorded complete
  shogi game, 1607; an 1856 Edo Castle game); (11) Shogi Handicap Games (2-piece through rook-only handicaps).
  By far the richest and most systematically organized of the three Shogi titles — the natural primary
  source if the Shogi+Chess minigame task gets picked up.

**Updated note, 2026-07-23:** all 3 titles are now at least partially readable. *The Art of Shogi* in
particular has a genuinely complete, well-organized TOC — a strong primary source for the flagged
Shogi+Chess synthesized-strategy-game minigame idea. *Better Moves for Better Shogi*'s bilingual layout
remains a real, narrower OCR limitation (not a missing-tool problem).

### Top level (5 files)

- **Astrolinguistics** — Alexander Ollongren. Formal/mathematical approach to constructing messages for
  interstellar communication (METI/SETI) using Lincos-style logical languages.

  forensic linguistics, expert-witness casework); full chapter list not fully captured this pass.
- **Language and Time** — Vyvyan Evans. Three-part structure: Part I lays out the philosophical/linguistic
  background on time; Part II covers tense and grammatical aspect; Part III covers lexical semantics of time
  words. Full chapter breakdown within each part captured.
- **Language Change: Progress or Decay?** — Jean Aitchison. Three-part, 11+ chapter structure: the

- **A User's Guide to Thought and Meaning** — Ray Jackendoff (2012, OUP). Popular/accessible restatement of
  his semantics program. Part One: Language, Words, and Meaning (14 chapters — what's a language, word
  meaning, "objective" vs. "subjective" meaning, meanings vs. concepts, linguistic relativity); Part Two:
  Consciousness and Perception (what it's like to be thinking, tests of the "Unconscious Meaning Hypothesis").
- **Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, Evolution** (2002). Part covering rules of grammar,
  lexical redundancy/inheritance hierarchies, then Chapter 4 "Universal Grammar" (poverty-of-stimulus
  argument, linguistic universals, genetics of UG, species-specificity evidence); Part II Architectural
  Foundations; Chapter 7 covers structure-constrained modularity and Fodor's modularity thesis; Chapter 8
  "An Evolutionary Perspective on the Architecture" (Bickerton's proposal, protophonology, phrase structure
  evolution); Part III Semantic and Conceptual Foundations opens with "Semantics as a Mentalistic Enterprise."
- **Language, Consciousness, Culture: Essays on Mental Structure** (2007, Jean Nicod Lectures). Chapter 2
  covers the "Parallel Architecture" framework directly — three founding themes of generative grammar, the
  "broken promise" that deep structure would be the key to the mind, "syntactocentrism" as a scientific
  mistake, phonology as an exemplar of Parallel Architecture, the lexicon/grammar distinction, words-and-rules.
- **Patterns in the Mind: Language and Human Nature** (2015 printing) — **scanned/image-only PDF (tiff2pdf),
  required OCR** (`pdftoppm` + `tesseract`, page 6). Full contents recovered: Part I The Fundamental
  Arguments (nature/nurture, argument for mental grammar, argument for innate knowledge); Part II The
  Organization of Mental Grammar (overview, phonological structure, syntactic structure, American Sign
  Language); Part III Evidence for the Biological Basis of Language (how children learn language, language
  acquisition in unusual circumstances, language and the brain); Part IV Mental Capacities Other Than
  Language (construction of experience, music and vision, language as a window on thought, social
  organization).
- **Semantics and Cognition** (1983, MIT Press, Current Studies in Linguistics series #8). Part I Basic
  Issues (Semantic Structure and Conceptual Structure; Sense and Reference); Part II Cognitive Foundations of
  Semantics (Individuation; The Syntax of Conceptual Structure; Categorization; Semantic Structure Is
  Conceptual Structure); Part III Word Meanings (Problems of Lexical Analysis; Preference Rule Systems);
  Part IV Applications (TOC continues beyond what was captured).
- **Simpler Syntax** — Peter W. Culicover & Ray Jackendoff (2005). Chapter 2 covers uniform lexical
  projection/passive, the Structure-Preserving Hypothesis, raising, government and binding, trace theory;
  Chapter 3 "Later History of Mainstream Syntax" (Late PPT, UTAH, Head Movement, the Minimalist Program,
  "Uniformity entails Generative Semantics"); Chapter 4 "Flat Structure."
- **The Architecture of the Language Faculty** (1997, Linguistic Inquiry Monographs series). Covers anaphora
  and binding inside lexical items; a chapter on morphosyntax vs. morphophonology, inflectional vs.
  derivational morphology, productivity/semiproductivity, "optimal coding" of semiproductive forms; a later
  chapter on lexical insertion of idioms, parallels between idioms and compounds, and Construction Grammar.
  This is Jackendoff's core statement of the "Parallel Architecture" (syntax/semantics/phonology as
  independent generative systems linked by interface rules) that recurs across several of the other titles
  in this subfolder.

- **Ein Compendium sumerisch-akkadischer Beschwörungen** — Wolfgang Schramm (2008, Göttinger Beiträge zum
  Alten Orient Band 2, German). Not a grammar — a reconstructed collection of 21 Sumerian and
  Sumerian-Akkadian incantations/exorcism texts tied to the god Enki (Ea) and his son Asalluhi (Marduk),
  reconstructed mainly from Ashurbanipal's library at Nineveh (7th c. BCE) with some material tracing to the
  2nd millennium BCE. Structure: Ch. 1 Introduction (incl. "Der Inhalt des Compendiums" = contents overview);
  Ch. 2 Standard Text and Translation, one section per incantation (21 total).
- **An Introduction to the Grammar of Sumerian** — Gábor Zólyomi ("Zolyomi Sumer READER"). Lesson-based
  textbook structure: Lesson 1 Introduction (sources, writing system, dialects, Sumerian-Akkadian
  bilingualism); Lesson 2 Phonology (consonants, vowel harmony, syllable structure/stress); Lesson 3 The
  Nominal Template and Non-Adverbial Cases (ergative/absolutive, genitive, equative); Lesson 4 Genitive
  Constructions — each lesson includes "Further readings" and "Exercises."

  logogram words and 2,511 Sumerian compound words, with notes on cuneiform sign readings and homophone
  notation conventions.
- **A Sumerian Reader** — Konrad Volk, with Silvano Votto & Annette Zgoll (2nd rev. ed., 1999, Studia Pohl:
  Series Maior #18, Pontifical Biblical Institute). Scanned PDF; a selection of annotated Sumerian texts for
  reading practice rather than a systematic grammar.
- **Sumerian Liturgical Texts** — Stephen Herbert Langdon. Scanned/OCR'd. Contents: Introduction; then a
  series of Sumerian liturgical texts in translation — an epic poem on the origin of Sumerian civilization, a
  lamentation to Aruru, a penitential psalm to the god Amurru, a lamentation on the invasion by Gutium, the
  Legend of Gilgamesh, and liturgical hymns to Ur-Engur, Dungi, and Libit-Ishtar/Ishme-Dagan.
- **A Sumerian Grammar and Chrestomathy** — Stephen Langdon. Scanned/OCR'd (page-number column badly

  abbreviations for the cited cuneiform text corpora.
- **The Sumerian Language: An Introduction to Its History and Grammatical Structure** — Marie-Louise Thomsen
  (1984, 3rd printing, Copenhagen Studies in Assyriology Vol. 10). Full table of contents: Preface;
  Acknowledgements; Introduction; Grammar (opens with Phonetics) — the standard modern academic reference
  grammar of the language.
- **Sumerian Grammar** — Thorkild Jacobsen. Only 21 pages — a short typed/mimeographed lecture-handout style
  document (property of the American Schools of Oriental Research, per a repeating watermark that required
  rasterized OCR to see past). Covers Jacobsen's own analytical framework: the "nexus" relationship
  (ergative/subject roles), verbids, a detailed structure-of-the-verb system (modal prefixes, mode-of-awareness
  prefixes tied to the speaker's psychological "ken," personal/neuter comitative and locative infixes), and
  worked example sentences from Sumerian literary texts (Gudea Cylinder, Shulgi Hymn, the Aratta epic).

**Why this subfolder matters:** the developer's existing lore already ties in-game Sumerian speech to a
concrete in-fiction origin — the U.R.U.K. origin-lab (see `project_sumerian_flagged` memory, marked
RESOLVED). This is real source material for that thread if it's ever revisited in depth.

## Not yet touched this pass

The following folders under `Reference/Materials/books/` were not surveyed in this cataloging pass at all:
`Math_and_Computation/` (161 files — deliberately deferred by the developer 2026-07-23, expected to be
large: "we'll need to set aside Math_and_Computation/ for some other time, because that will probably eat
up the rest of my allotment"), `Cpp/`, and the loose
top-level singles (`Evolutionary Psychology and Information Systems Research.pdf`, `Human Universals -
Donald E Brown`, `King-Warrior-Magician-Lover`, `Mythology - Matt Clayton`, `Some of the Dead Are Still
Breathing`, `sound_travelling_through_bone...`, `The Art of Character`, `The History of Our Universe in 21
Stars`, `The Routledge International Handbook of Dialectical Thinking`). Flag for a future pass if the
developer wants them included.
